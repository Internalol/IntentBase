# IntentBase

The client base made Nefarious Intent owner of [Intent Store](https://intent.store) made during his [How to Code a Minecraft 1.8 Hacked Client series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n33Ig58s9YQ&list=PLhgpmtS-kfPfoXwj-LlgavSXr3AoTnZ34&index=2)

## Not the exact same
I didn't make everything the exact same like TabGUI, Killaura and other shit like that


### Most likely never gonna update this again
Unless Nefarious wants to update his tutorial series

`git clone https://github.com/DivineEnergylol/IntentBase`
Replace src/minecraft with this repo
